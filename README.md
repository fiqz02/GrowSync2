## Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
   - Role-based access control for users and administrators.

### 2. **Irrigation Control**
   - Adjust water valve angles and set irrigation timers.
   - Monitor the irrigation process with real-time countdowns.
   - Firebase-based remote control for servo motors.

### 3. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time monitoring of:
     - Temperature (Â°C)
     - Humidity (%)
     - pH Levels
     - Water Level (%)
   - Status indication with color codes (normal, near normal, far from normal).

### 4. **Data Visualization**
   - Interactive graphs to analyze trends for temperature and humidity.
   - Real-time data fetched from Firebase, displayed with average, highest, and lowest readings.

### 5. **User Profile Management**
   - Upload, update, and delete profile photos.
   - View user-specific details such as email.
   - Logout functionality.

### 6. **Alert Notifications**
   - Receive real-time push notifications for critical events, such as:
     - Extreme sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity, pH levels).
     - Completion of irrigation cycles.
   - Notifications are powered by Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
